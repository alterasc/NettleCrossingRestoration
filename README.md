# Pathfinder Kingmaker mod: Restoration of Nettle's Crossing

Adds Kingdom project to restore Nettle's Crossing (bridge over the Shrike river on the global map).
Costs 50 BP and takes 10 days. Can be solved by Regent or Treasurer.

Has the same conditions as Nettle's Curse research - you just need to kill Stag Lord and talk to Nettle afterwards.

If you're installing this mid-game where you progressed past that point and project doesn't appear - use Bag of Tricks or Kingdom Resolution to uhlock flag `RiverCrossingAllowed`, this will make Crossing available.

## Installation
1. Install Unity Mod Manager
2. Install this.
